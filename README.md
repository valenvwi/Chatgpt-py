#### This platform offers secure communication with enforced user authentication. Users can engage in conversations with an AI assistant in the chatroom, while also having the ability to access and review their chat histories. It's a safe and feature-rich environment for interactive discussions and seamless AI-powered interactions.

#### Main Tech Stack:
###### Backend: Incorporating SimpleJWT for secure token-based authentication, Django Rest Framework for building robust APIs, Django Cors Headers for handling cross-origin requests, and OpenAI for advanced AI-driven interactions.

###### Frontend: Leveraging Material-UI for a sleek and modern user interface, Formik for form management, and Date.js for handling date-related operations."
